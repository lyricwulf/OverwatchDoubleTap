# Overwatch Double Tap
ODT is a simple AHK script that allows you to double tap a key to activate another key. This is useful for adding an extra keybind for characters with many abilities in their kit and allows the user to have this extra dimension of control without having to sacrifice a keybind.

# Usage
The easiest way to use ODT is by downloading [the latest OverwatchDoubleTap.exe](https://github.com/lyricwulf/OverwatchDoubleTap/releases/latest/download/OverwatchDoubleTap.exe) and running it.

> If you have AHK v2 installed, you can also run the `.ahk` file in this repo.

FAQ:
<details>
  <summary>Can I get in trouble for using this?</summary>
  
  Probably not! Since this is remapping one key to another, it is generally allowed under the "one action per key press" rule-of-thumb. However, that is just a guideline, and if you're worried about it, you can always run this in the Practice Range or Custom Games to just try it out.
