# Overwatch Double Tap
ODT is a simple AHK script that allows you to double tap a key to activate another key. This is useful for adding an extra keybind for characters with many abilities in their kit and allows the user to have this extra dimension of control without having to sacrifice a keybind.

## Usage
Do you have AutoHotKey v2 installed?

- **NO or don't know:** You can download the `.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/lyricwulf/OverwatchDoubleTap) and run it.
- **YES:** You can download the `.ahk` and run it.
